  "description": "I helped design and build this project for years as a hobby, and led the attempt to take it to the market. Through many iterations, tests and rides, we've built a robust solution for the urban micro-mobility field. Won the first place in Maof's accelerator in Ashdod, and eventually laying this project to rest during the first months of Covid, this has been one of the most challenging and fun projects I took part in. I still use it and ride it to this day.",
